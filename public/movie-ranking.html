<h3>Sonic Youth</h3>
<p>I'm currently very invested in Sonic Youth, learning some of Kim's bass lines. Thursten is inspiring me to experiment with music overall, not just with bass. Hopefully, I will be able to assimilate the information and create unique if not similar sounds that he and the band overall have made.</p>

<h3>Imperial Triumphant</h3>
<p>What can I say? Jazz musicians making avant garde black metal. Again, the bassist is blowing me away with his creativity. Sliding a wine bottle down the G string while fretting. Honestly, I can almost see comparions between him and Sonic Youth</p>

<h3>Black metal overall, especially the 'Music for Goblin People'</h3>
<p>Currently listening to a lot of black metal while reading 'Melancology', a book about black metal theory and ecology. Enjoying it a lot and finding a whole new understanding and appreciation of the genre. Pity it's filled with NSBM bands.</p>
